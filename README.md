"However, I do know that this section of the movie contains some absolutely Eurostile-tastic HAL 9000 screens"
Telemetry screens use "Manifold" from Selectric type Elements.

“A lot of the readouts were generic,” further explained Bruce Logan4, the talented cameraman mentioned by Trumbull, “– nothing very carefully thought out. There just needed to be something moving on the viewscreens. Doug and I would strip up graphs and such, and then start blinking on lettering and numbers.”

Eurostile costs to license, but OPTI edgar bold extended appears to be a suitable personal-use option.
