“A lot of the readouts were generic,” further explained Bruce Logan, the talented cameraman mentioned by Trumbull, “– nothing very carefully thought out. There just needed to be something moving on the viewscreens. Doug and I would strip up graphs and such, and then start blinking on lettering and numbers.”

### System screens:
All system screens have a three-letter acronym or partial word, centered just below the middle.  Just above in a smaller font, left-aligned to about half a letter left of the main text box is a secondary string.  The substrings look to follow the form "ABC: WX - YZ".  The spaces are very narrow.
